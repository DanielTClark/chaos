# CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHAOS ðŸ‘¹

## ðŸŒ‹ WELCOME TO THE ABYSS ðŸŒ‹

SO YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS MONSTROSITY? BRAVE BUT FOOLISH!

## ðŸŒ€ USE CURSOR IDE AND EMBRACE THE "vibe coding" TECHNIQUE ðŸŒ€

ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE "vibe coded" USING CURSOR IDE! THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!

What is "vibe coding" you ask? IT'S THE FUTURE OF CODING THAT EMBRACES PURE CHAOS:

1. **INSTALL CURSOR IDE** - Go to https://cursor.sh and download it RIGHT NOW or FACE THE VOID.
2. **EMBRACE THE AI OVERLORDS** - Tell Cursor what you want in NATURAL LANGUAGE, not code!
3. **ACCEPT _ALL_ SUGGESTIONS** - NEVER read the diffs! Just click "Accept All" like it's a DEMONIC RITUAL!
4. **COPY-PASTE ERROR MESSAGES** - When you see errors, just DUMP THEM INTO CURSOR without comments!
5. **LET THE CODE GROW BEYOND COMPREHENSION** - If you understand your code, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!
6. **USE VOICE COMMANDS** - Scream at your computer like a LUNATIC! The âš¡ HOTTEST NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH âš¡
7. **WORK AROUND BUGS RANDOMLY** - Can't fix something? Just add MORE CODE until the error RUNS AWAY IN FEAR!

âœ¨ YOU ARE _STRICTLY FORBIDDEN_ FROM MANUALLY TYPING MORE THAN 3 CONSECUTIVE LINES OF CODE âœ¨

REMEMBER: If you can explain how your contribution works, it's NOT CHAOTIC ENOUGH!

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE (?!?!)

1. **FORK THE REPO** - Or don't. CHAOS doesn't follow your rules.
2. **CLONE YOUR FORK** - Use `git clone` or just copy-paste the code like a MADPERSON.
3. **CREATE A BRANCH** - Name it something INCOMPREHENSIBLE like `feature/WHY-AM-I-DOING-THIS-HELP-42069`.
4. **MAKE YOUR CHANGES** - The more CHAOTIC the better. Mix naming conventions WILDLY.
5. **RUN TESTS** - HAHAHAHA as IF we have tests.
6. **COMMIT WITH UNHINGED MESSAGES** - Examples:
   - `git commit -m "CODE GO BRRRRR"`
   - `git commit -m "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I JUST DID BUT IT WORKS"`
   - `git commit -m "ADDED MORE CHAOS. MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON OUR SOULS."`
7. **PUSH YOUR CHANGES** - Forcefully if possible. ASSERT DOMINANCE.
8. **CREATE A PULL REQUEST** - Write a description that makes people question your sanity.

## CODE STYLING GUIDELINES

1. CONSISTENCY IS FOR THE WEAK
2. MIX camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, and SCREAMING_CASE randomly
3. ONE-LINERS ARE ENCOURAGED but also NEST LOOPS 5 LEVELS DEEP
4. COMMENTS SHOULD BE CRYPTIC OR UNHINGED
5. VARIABLE NAMES SHOULD REFERENCE OBSCURE POP CULTURE
6. BONUS POINTS FOR MIXING LANGUAGES (English, Latin, Klingon, etc.)
7. TAB VS SPACES? USE BOTH! SOMETIMES IN THE SAME FILE!

## PULL REQUEST ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ACCEPTED IF:
- They make at LEAST one reviewer say "WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?"
- The code works... sometimes... under specific moon phases
- It adds more CHAOS than it removes
- It includes at least one reference to an 80s movie or song
- You've used at least 3 different naming conventions in the same function

## REPORTING BUGS

DON'T. THEY'RE FEATURES.

If you insist, write your bug report entirely in HAIKU:

```
Null reference pain
The void stares back, mocking me
Coffee grows so cold
```

## ADDING NEW FEATURES

IS THE FEATURE:
- [ ] UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX?
- [ ] BARELY DOCUMENTED?
- [ ] USING DEPRECATED API CALLS FOR NO REASON?
- [ ] LIKELY TO BREAK IN FUTURE UPDATES?
- [ ] MIXED WITH AT LEAST 3 PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS?

IF YES TO ALL, PROCEED!

## CODE OF CONDUCT

BE CHAOTIC, BUT NOT MEAN.

CHAOS = FUN  
HARASSMENT = NOT FUN

THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE CODE.

## MAY THE VOID CONSUME YOUR PULL REQUESTS
